# Arduino-Nano---NRF24L01-Controller
NRF24L01 powered wireless controller, this controller is provided with 2 dual axes joysticks, and 10 buttons.

This repo provides files to create your own wirelles controller. Our main reason to create this controller was to control a Drone wich is also done by the same team.

Phis project is based on an Arduino Nano, later we will provide a newer version with an Arduino Micro to power the board
